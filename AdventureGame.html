    <p>You and four friends are driving cross country. It is the middle of the night and your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. There is a house
      up the road, the first building you all have seen in hours. You decide to go ask for help. Do you leave people to watch the car, or do you all go to the house together?</P>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene2A")'>You decide to split up.</button>

    <p>Since it was your idea, you stay at the car, along with one of your friends. You settle down to wait, keeping one eye out for anyone driving by.</p>
    <p>Before too long you hear an old truck drive up and slowly stop. A man gets out and walks toward your car</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene3A")'>You get out of the car and talk to him.</button>
