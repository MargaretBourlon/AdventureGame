  <div id='scene1'>
    <p>You and four friends are driving cross country. It is the middle of the night and your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. There is a house
      up the road, the first building you all have seen in hours. You decide to go ask for help. Do you leave people to watch the car, or do you all go to the house together?</P>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene2A")'>You decide to split up.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene2B")'>You decide to stick together.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene2A'>
    <p>Since it was your idea, you stay at the car, along with one of your friends. You settle down to wait, keeping one eye out for anyone driving by.</p>
    <p>Before too long you hear an old truck drive up and slowly stop. A man gets out and walks toward your car</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene3A")'>You get out of the car and talk to him.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='switchScene("scene2A", "scene2B")'>You get out of the car and head toward the house.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene3A'>
    <p>He says he lives in the house that your friends headed towards. He also says that he has the tools to fix your car in his garage.</p>
    <p>He offers to go get the tools and asks if you'd like to ride with him to his house.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death1")'>You decide to go with him.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death2")'>You decide to stay with the car.</button>
  </div>

  <div id="death1">
    <p>He was obviosly a pshycho killer. You are never seen or heard from again.</p>
    <p>You lose. The end.</p>
  </div>

  <div id='scene2B'>
    <p>You lock up the car and walk toward the house.</p>
    <p>You ring the doorbell, but no one answers.</p>
    <p>You notice the door is unlocked.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene4A")'>You enter the house, looking for a landline.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene4B")'>You wait on the porch, hoping the owner will appear.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='death2'>
    <p>Hours later the man comes back. He has a crazy look in his eye and is holding some kind of machete. He runs toward you, swinging the weapon, and you run away as fast as humanly possible.</p>
    <p>You get away, but are lost in the middle of nowhere without food, water, or celluar service. You are never seen again.</p>
    <p>You lose. The end.</p>
  </div>

  <div id='scene4A'>
    <p>You push the door open and find yourself in an old fashioned farm house, with no phone in sight. You start exploring.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene5A")'>You head up the stairs.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene5B")'>You explore the main floor.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene5A'>
    <p>You creep up the stairs, giving each room a cursory glance, looking for a phone line.</p>
    <p>In what looks like the master bedroom you see a cord going into a cabinet. You open the cabinet and find a well-maintained collection of knives and some bloody clothes</p>
    <p>Just then you hear a car pull up to the house and shut off.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death3")'>You go investigate the sound.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene6A")'>You stay where you are.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene6B")'>You hide.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene5B'>
    <p>You wander around the downstairs of the farm house. The only weird thing you notice is that there are no phones.</p>
    <p>Just then you hear a car pull up to the house and shut off.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death3")'>You go investigate the sound.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death4")'>You stay where you are.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene6B")'>You hide.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='death3'>
    <p>You find the makeshift garage behind the house. You see a man inside and enter to ask him for help.</p>
    <p>He turns around and you see the knife he was hiding. You try to run, but have no where to go. You manage a scream to warn your friends before he gets you.</p>
    <p>You lose. The end.</p>
  </div>

  <div id='scene6A'>
    <p>You idle in the bedroom, staring at the knives and trying to decide what to say to the owner when they find you.</p>
    <p>You hear one of your friends, who was searching the downstairs, scream once. You don't hear anything else.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death5")'>You go looking for your friend.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene7A")'>You hide.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene6B'>
    <p>You find a closet underneath the stair case to hide in. You hear the owner of the house come inside the house.</p>
    <p>You hear one of your friends, who was searching the downstairs, scream once. You don't hear anything else.</p>
    <p>Soon you hear water running. Maybe he's in the shower?</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death6")'>You go see if he has a cell phone.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene7B")'>You stay where you are.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death6")'>You head toward the garage.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='death4'>
    <p>The owner comes into the house and finds you in his living room. He pauses, suprized to see you, before pulling out a knife and running toward you.</p>
    <p>You manage a scream to warn your friends before he gets you.</p>
    <p>You lose. The end.</p>
  </div>

  <div id='death5'>
    <p>You walk out of the bedroom and straight into the owner</p>
    <p>He was looking for more people after finding someone downstairs. You don't even have time to scream</p>
    <p>You lose. The end</p>
  </div>

  <div id='scene7A'>
    <p>You look around frantically and end up hiding under the bed.</p>
    <p>You watch from under the bed as the owner of the house comes into the room. His feet move from the door to the bathroom, where you hear water running.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death6")'>You make a run for it.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene8A")'>You stay under the bed.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='death6'>
    <p>You creep out of your hiding place and run straight into the owner</p>
    <p>He was looking for more people after finding someone downstairs. You don't even have time to scream</p>
    <p>You lose. The end</p>
  </div>

  <div id='scene7B'>
    <p>You hear what sounds like one of your friends creeping out of their hiding spot. Then you hear them scream.</p>
    <p>There's running, followed by a dull thud. Footsteps head back up the stairs. You wait for ages, but don't hear anything else.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("escape1")'>You head for the garage.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene8B")'>You head to the upstairs bedroom.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene8A'>
    <p>Seconds later, you see the feet emerge from the bathroom and go back to the hallway.</p>
    <p>You hear one of your friends scream. There's running, followed by a dull thud. Footsteps head back up the stairs. You wait for ages, but don't hear anything else.</p>
    <p>After ages of waiting for more intruders to come out, the owner finally goes to bed. You wait until he has been snoring for a long time before you move.</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene8B")'>You head for the garage.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("scene9A")'>You help yourself to a knife from the cabinet.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='escape1'>
    <p>You make it to the garage and steal the car. You don't know if any of your friends are still alive, but you aren't waiting around to find out.</p>
    <p>You promise yourself you'll send the police to the house as soon as you can.</p>
    <p>Congratulations, you survived.</p>
  </div>

  <div id='scene8B'>
    <p>The door is shut but the snoring you hear makes you confident enough to push the door open.</p>
    <p>Unfortnatly the door squeaks and wakes him up. He grabs the knife from his nightstand and runs at you</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("death7")'>You turn and run.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("escape2")'>You run toward the open knife cabinet.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='scene9A'>
    <p>Knife in hand, you stare at the man lying in his bed</p>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("escape3")'>You head for the garage.</button>
    <button type="button" class='btn btn-success btn-lg' onclick='showNext("killer")'>You stab the sleeping man.</button>
  </div>

  <div id='death7'>
    <p>He catches up to you easily</p>
    <p>You lose. The end.</p>
  </div>

  <div id='escape2'>
    <p>You two fight franitcally, and during the struggle you manage to stab him.</p>
    <p>Congratulations, you survived</p>

  <div id='escape3'>
    <p>When you pull the door open, the hinges squeak and the man wakes up.</p>
    <p>He grabs a knife and runs at you. You two fight franitcally, and during the struggle you manage to stab him.</p>
    <p>Congratulations, you survived</p>
  </div>

  <div id='killer'>
    <p>The man dies without waking up. You smile as you consider all the hard work that went into planning this trap for your "friends." But you did it.</p>
    <p>You killed some yourself, and designed traps for the others. You sabatouged the car and picked this house in the middle of nowhere for the main event.</p>
    <p>You knew the owner would have to die but, oh well, right? It was worth it.</p>
    <p>You steal his car (it's not like he'll need it anymore) and drive off. By the time anyone finds the bodies, you're long gone.</p>
